Explore Nauvis' moon of Muluna, and take your first step into space. Revamps the Space Science pack to be crafted on Muluna. The surface is devoid of life, but who knows what lurks in the planet's many craters?

Muluna's low gravity makes it easier to launch rockets from than from Nauvis or other planets, making it an ideal location for constructing space platforms and shipping materials to other planets. However, the low pressure makes it impossible to craft any science other than Space Science.

Your first space platform is likely to look very different from a typical Space Age platform. You will not initially have access to asteroid collectors or crushers, so your first platform will be completely dependent on shipments from Nauvis. Thruster fuel can be made from rocket fuel, and like in vanilla, oxidizer can be made from iron ore. Luckily, there are no dangerous asteroids between Nauvis and Muluna, so you can skip placing turrets on any Nauvis-Muluna ships.

Rocket part costs are doubled on every planet except for Muluna, but in return, Rocket Part Productivity is a technology that is present throughout all of Space Age. Four levels of Rocket Part Productivity are available on Muluna, and two are available on Vulcanus, Gleba, and Fulgora respectively. Unlike other bonus technologies, Rocket Part Productivity has a non-linear research order.

This mod currently relies on vanilla prototypes for many world features. While this is likely to become less true with time, any mod that removes vanilla terrain features, such as Alien Biomes, is likely to crash on startup with this mod unless a fix is made specifically for that mod.
